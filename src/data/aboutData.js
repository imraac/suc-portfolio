    description2: "I am a student at Moringa School, currently learning Fullstack Web-Development. A project that I worked on towards the end of my time in moringa is a Learning Management System (LMS). This project allowed me to apply a wide range of technical skills, including backend and frontend development, database management, and API integration.
